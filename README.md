# login-with-blink-button
using html Css
We create a simple login form within a container.

The submit button (<button>) has a blinking animation using the @keyframes animation called blink. This animation toggles the button's opacity between 0 and 1, creating a blinking effect.

The button also has a hover effect to change its background color when hovered.

You can further customize the form, add functionality to process the login data, and style it as needed for your application.
